# 📸 CAUGHT IN CLASS  - Attendance System

### CAUGHT IN CLASS is an AI-driven classroom attendance system that utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for face detection, along with OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas for efficientstudent tracking. This project automates attendance-taking, reducing manual work and improving accuracy.

# 🚀 Features
### ✅ Face Detection with YOLO – Fast and accurate student identification. 
### ✅ Automated Attendance Logging – Stores attendance records in structured files using Pandas. 
### ✅ Real-Time Processing – Uses OpenCV for live video feed analysis.
### ✅ Data Export – Saves attendance logs in CSV format for easy access.
### ✅ User-Friendly – Simple and efficient, requiring minimal human intervention.
# 🛠️ Tech Stack
### Programming Language: Python
## Libraries Used:
### 🖼️ OpenCV – For real-time video processing.
### 🎯 YOLO – For efficient face detection.
### 📊 Pandas – For structured attendance data handling.
### 🔢 NumPy – For numerical computations.
# 🎯 How It Works
### Captures Live Video 📹 – The system connects to a webcam or external camera.
### Detects Faces Using YOLO 🧠 – The model processes each frame to recognize students.
### Matches & Logs Attendance 📊 – Recognized faces are marked as present and stored in a CSV file.
### Exports Attendance Data 📄 – Attendance reports are saved for future analysis.
